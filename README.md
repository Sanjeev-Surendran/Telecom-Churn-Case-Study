# Telecom Churn Case Study
A case study to solve a business problem by building a machine learning model to predict if a telecom customer will churn or not.
* Comprehend the given data set and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse the data set.
* Build a prediction model to identify the best fit variables that can predict the churning probability more accurately.

### General Information
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

#### Data Set Brief Information
The data set contains information about the customer and details of their respective telecom usage.
A data dictionary is provided along with the data set to understand various terms and variables used.

#### Business Objective
Analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

#### Business Solution
Build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided and their respective usage.

### Conclusion
Any business analytics problem can be solved using **CR**oss **I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining (CRISP-DM) model.
* Data set was analysed and prepared for EDA. EDA was done on data set to understand the relationship between variables.
* Various machine learning models was built with and without PCA to predict if a customer will churn or not

#### Recommendation
Random Forest gives good prediction results without PCA
